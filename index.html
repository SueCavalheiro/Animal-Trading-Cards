      <p class="info">As the name suggests, red foxes have rusty reddish-brown fur.
	This can vary in colouration and can give rise to black, silver or cross morphs.
	Their long, bushy tail, known as a ‘brush’ or ‘sweep’ is often tipped with white
	fur and the backs of the ears are black, as are part of the legs. They have white
	underparts. During the autumn and winter, the Red Fox will grow more fur. This so called
	‘winter fur’ keeps the animal warm in colder environments. The fox sheds this fur at the
	beginning of spring, reverting back to the short fur for the duration of the summer.</p>
